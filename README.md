# Compiler-for-Expressions-E-with-AVL-Trees
ExpressiveCompiler is a powerful compiler designed to handle arithmetic expressions, mathematical operations, and memory management commands efficiently. It features a memory address storage-retrieval system based on Adelson-Velskii and Landis (AVL) Trees, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.

Key Features:

->**Arithmetic Expression Handling:** ExpressiveCompiler is capable of parsing and processing arithmetic expressions and mathematical operations with precision and efficiency, enabling users to write complex computations seamlessly.

->**Memory Management with AVL Trees:** The compiler implements a sophisticated memory address storage-retrieval system using AVL Trees, ensuring fast and reliable memory management. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of variables and data structures, optimizing overall performance.

->**Compiler Functionality:** Users can input programs written in E++ language, and ExpressiveCompiler translates them into machine language Targ, enabling execution on target systems. This compilation process ensures compatibility and portability across different platforms.

->**Support for Commands:** The compiler supports essential commands such as delete and return, enhancing flexibility and control over program execution. These commands enable users to manage memory and control program flow effectively.

->**Efficient Code Generation:** ExpressiveCompiler generates optimized machine code, maximizing performance and minimizing resource usage. This ensures that compiled programs execute efficiently on target systems, meeting performance requirements.

This project represents a significant advancement in compiler technology, offering a robust solution for handling arithmetic expressions and memory management tasks. With its efficient implementation and support for essential commands, ExpressiveCompiler provides developers with a versatile tool for translating E++ programs into executable machine code.
